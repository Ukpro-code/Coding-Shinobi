# PDF Concept Extraction Process

## How the PDF Processor Works

The PDF processor in the application follows these steps to extract concepts from PDF documents:

### 1. **File Upload & Validation**
- User uploads a PDF file via drag-and-drop or file browser
- System validates the file type (must be application/pdf)
- File information is displayed (name, size)

### 2. **Text Extraction** (Currently Simulated)
- **Status**: "Extracting text content..."
- **Real Implementation**: Would use PDF.js library to parse PDF and extract text
- **Current**: Uses mock text content for demonstration
- Extracts text from all pages while maintaining structure

### 3. **AI Concept Analysis** (Currently Simulated)
- **Status**: "Analyzing concepts with AI..."
- **Real Implementation**: Would send extracted text to AI service (OpenAI, local LLM, etc.)
- **Current**: Returns predefined mock concepts
- AI identifies key concepts, themes, and ideas from the text

### 4. **Concept Structuring**
Each extracted concept includes:
```typescript
interface ExtractedConcept {
  id: string           // Unique identifier
  title: string        // Concept name/title
  description: string  // Brief explanation
  relevance: number    // Relevance score (0-1)
  category: string     // Topic category
  pageNumber?: number  // Source page reference
}
```

### 5. **Mock Concepts Generated**
The current implementation generates these sample concepts:
- **Database Normalization** (Relevance: 0.9)
- **Entity-Relationship Modeling** (Relevance: 0.85)
- **RESTful API Design** (Relevance: 0.92)
- **React Hooks** (Relevance: 0.88)
- **Query Optimization** (Relevance: 0.75)
- **Authentication Strategies** (Relevance: 0.82)

### 6. **Integration with Thinking Space**
- Concepts are displayed in the processor with relevance indicators
- User can review and select which concepts to add
- When "Add to Thinking Space" is clicked, concepts become nodes
- Each concept becomes a visual bubble in the thinking space
- Connections between related concepts are automatically suggested

## Technical Implementation Details

### Current Status (Mock Implementation)
```typescript
// Simulated text extraction
const mockExtractedText = `Database Design Fundamentals...`

// Simulated AI analysis
const mockConcepts: ExtractedConcept[] = [
  {
    id: 'pdf-1',
    title: 'Database Normalization',
    description: 'Process of organizing data to reduce redundancy...',
    relevance: 0.9,
    category: 'Database Design',
    pageNumber: 1
  }
  // ... more concepts
]
```

### Real Implementation Would Include:
1. **PDF.js Integration**: For actual text extraction
2. **AI Service Integration**: OpenAI GPT, Claude, or local LLM
3. **NLP Processing**: For better concept identification
4. **OCR Support**: For scanned PDFs
5. **Image Analysis**: Extract concepts from diagrams/charts

## User Experience Flow

1. **Upload**: User drags PDF or clicks to browse
2. **Processing**: Visual progress indicator shows extraction stages
3. **Review**: Concepts displayed with relevance scores and categories
4. **Selection**: User can review before adding to thinking space
5. **Integration**: Concepts become interactive nodes in the visual map

This system transforms static PDF content into an interactive knowledge graph where users can explore connections between ideas.
