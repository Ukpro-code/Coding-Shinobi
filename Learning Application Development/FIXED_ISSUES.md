# ✅ Fixed Issues - PDF Upload & Library Management

## 🔧 Issues Resolved

### 1. **PDF Viewer Options** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Dual viewer options (Browser + PDF.js) were confusing
- **Solution**: Removed dual options, now uses only PDF.js viewer
- **Result**: Clean, single PDF viewing experience

### 2. **Library File Reopening** ✅ FIXED  
- **Problem**: Clicking library files didn't reopen them
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `openLibraryFile()` function in frontend
  - Added `/api/content/{id}/file` endpoint in backend
  - Made library items clickable with proper file serving
- **Result**: Library files now properly reopen for viewing

### 3. **Library Management** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: No search, filter, sort, or delete functionality
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive library management:
  - 🔍 **Search**: Real-time file name search
  - 🏷️ **Filter**: All files, PDF only, YouTube only
  - 📊 **Sort**: By date, title, or type
  - 🗑️ **Delete**: Safe deletion with confirmation
  - 📅 **File dates**: Display creation dates
  - 🎨 **Better UI**: Organized controls and layout
- **Result**: Full-featured library management system

### 4. **Authentication Issues** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Login failing with "Incorrect email or password"
- **Solution**: Fixed password hashing in database for existing users
- **Result**: Login now works with password: `testpassword123`

### 5. **Delete Functionality** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Internal server error (500) when deleting files
- **Solution**: 
  - Improved delete endpoint with better error handling
  - Handles missing files gracefully
  - Deletes related concepts from database
  - Provides detailed error messages
- **Result**: Files can be safely deleted from library
