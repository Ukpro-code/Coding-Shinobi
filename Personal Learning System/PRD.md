Executive Summary

Vision: Create an intentional information and knowledge consumption mechanism that transforms scattered learning into a connected, personal knowledge ecosystem.

Problem: Information overload prevents deep learning. Existing tools focus on consumption rather than connection and understanding.

Solution: An AI-powered personal learning companion that processes multi-format content, creates automatic knowledge connections, and provides a "thinking space" for natural knowledge exploration.

Target User

Primary User: Technical professionals and students who:

- Consume diverse content formats (YouTube, PDFs, articles, books)
- Struggle with information overload
- Want deeper understanding over surface-level consumption
- Value intentional learning over passive consumption
- Need to connect knowledge across domains

Initial Target: You (the builder) - validates product-market fit through personal use

Core Problem Statement

Current learning tools create fragmented knowledge silos:

- YouTube videos exist in isolation
- PDF summaries don't connect to related concepts
- Manual note-taking (Obsidian/Notion) creates friction
- No intelligent connection between different content types
- Knowledge consumption becomes busywork rather than learning

Product Goals

Primary Goals

1. Reduce information processing time by 60% through intelligent summarization
2. Increase knowledge retention through automatic concept connections
3. Enable serendipitous learning through the thinking space interface
4. Support natural learning rhythms (active/passive periods)

Success Metrics

- Time saved per learning session
- Number of cross-domain connections discovered
- Frequency of "aha!" moments (user-reported)
- Daily engagement with thinking space
