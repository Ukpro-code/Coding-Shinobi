Iris Flower Classification 

Iris flower has three species; setosa,versicolor and virginica, which differs according to their measuements
Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them
Although the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification, you can also download the same dataset from here. for the task of iris flower classification with machine learning,

To download Iris flower classification. 
- use datasets module provided by scikit learn. 
- Install scikit-learn (pip install scikit-learn)
- run the below given code 
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()

# Access the features and target
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Print the shape of the dataset
print(f"Features shape: {X.shape}")
print(f"Target shape: {y.shape}")

- Understand the dataset 
Load_iris -> function returns a dictionary like object with several attributes like 
data -> the feature of the dataset 
target -> labels of the dataset
feature_names -> the names of the features 
target_names -> names of the target classes 
DESCR -> description of the dataset 

to access the attributes use below code

# Print the feature names
print("Feature names:", iris.feature_names)

# Print the target names
print("Target names:", iris.target_names)

# Print the description of the dataset
print("Dataset description:\n", iris.DESCR)
