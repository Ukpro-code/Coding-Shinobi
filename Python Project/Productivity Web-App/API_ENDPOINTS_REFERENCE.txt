2. User wants task in calendar:
   Click Google button next to task → POST /tasks/123/add-to-google-calendar → Task becomes calendar event

3. User creates new event:
   Fill form + check "Add to Google Calendar" → POST /calendar/google/create → Event in both places

4. User creates meeting:

=================

Same endpoints work for everyone:
- User A: /calendar/sync → A's calendar
- User B: /calendar/sync → B's calendar

Google OAuth automatically identifies which user is making the request.
