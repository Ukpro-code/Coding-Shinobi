Build a Desktop app for productivity 
We propose a **web-based personal dashboard** launched as the browser homepage (in Chrome or any browser), with a Python backend. It integrates **calendar, tasks, journaling, goals, and more** into one customizable dashboard. Key sections include calendar sync (starting with Google Calendar), a to-do list, a gratitude journal (with AI prompt support), daily/weekly top tasks, goals with countdowns, a vision board for images/quotes, an important contacts list, meeting transcription (for Google Meet), focus and Pomodoro timers, and a always-on dark mode with Lofi music. Users can drag-and-drop rearrange modules on the dashboard. After a month of use, an AI model (e.g. GPT-4) would analyze the user’s habits and suggest recurring tasks for approval.

Features 
- Calendar integration & todolist - Use the Google Calendar API to display events and deadlines. Users can sync their calendar so scheduled events auto-populate tasks (as My Good Week does). The to-do list will allow multiple lists and priority flags. We plan a “Top 3 tasks of the day” and “Top 10 tasks of the week” summary view, drawn from the to-do list. (These echoes Momentum’s “Tasks integrations” and unlimited lists.) All tasks will be stored server-side (Python backend) and managed via a database.

- Journal section with Ai prompt for Journalling & Gratitude section - A rich text journal section where users can write entries. AI-generated prompts will appear to inspire entries (see AI section below). There will also be a separate gratitude journal page encouraging daily reflections. This draws from apps like *Gratitude*. We’ll include daily reminders/push notifications to encourage consistent journaling (as that app does). Both journal sections allow adding photos.
- Yearly goals, monthly goals section--> countdown clock to keep in track of the goals deadline for monthly and yearly goals Users set monthly and yearly goals with target deadlines. The dashboard shows countdown clocks for these deadlines. The vision board section lets users upload images, quotes, PDF clippings, and styled text. Our vision board will allow arranging multiple images with captions, and customize font/colors (even embed motivational videos).
- Important contacts sections - A CRM-style section where users store key personal or work contacts. This can be a simple address book: name, photo, notes, and maybe quick actions (call/email links). It syncs with address book data (Google Contacts API could be integrated later). This is unlike typical dashboards, so adds unique value.
- gmeet plugin integration to transcript meeting and add it "meeting notes". This plugin will transcribe the meeting and save it meeting notes.  the transcript text is saved into “Meeting Notes” in the app (one note per meeting). After meetings, we can use AI to summarize key points or extract action items. 
- After using the app for 30 days, Ai is trained with the user data, this Ai will Auto fill repetitive tasks post approval from user. 
- focus timer, the focus timer will turn into floating window when webpage is switched or minimized. so that the timer will keep running in the background. A prominent timer widget on the dashboard. It supports standard Pomodoro intervals (e.g. 25+5 min cycles) with user-adjustable durations. When the user switches tabs or minimizes the browser, the timer can pop out as a small always-on-top window (or system notification) so it continues running in view. This draws inspiration from focus tools: Flocus shows a countdown and on-break view, and Momentum has a “Focus Mode” and Pomodoro feature. We will implement the floating timer via a separate window (e.g. using the Web Notifications API or a small popup window).
- Dark mode always - The UI is exclusively dark by default to reduce eye strain. Users can switch themes or background images, but by default it’s a sleek dark dashboard. We will integrate a curated list of lofi/ambient playlists (e.g. via Spotify or YouTube embeds) so that playing “Focus Music” is just a click away. For instance, Momentum integrates calm rain or lofi sounds via Spotify/YouTube; we will provide similar options and controls.
- All sections above appear on the home dashboard and can be rearranged via drag-and-drop. The user can hide or show modules as desired. This mimics the flexibility of Notion/ClickUp dashboards but tailored for personal use.

## Monetization Strategy

Given the rich feature set, a **freemium subscription model** is appropriate. For example:

* **Free tier:** Basic calendar sync (Google only), to-do lists, and a simple journaling page without AI prompts. Limited number of tasks or goals.
* **Premium (Personal) subscription:** Unlocks all sections: AI-generated journal prompts, unlimited tasks/goals, vision board uploads, meeting transcripts, and music integration. Price estimate: similar apps charge \$5–\$10/month or \$50–\$100/year. (Momentum Plus is \$3.33/mo billed yearly; we may price slightly higher for more features.)
* **Lifetime License:** Optionally, a one-time purchase could grant permanent access to the Personal version (some users prefer this to recurring fees). This is less common for web apps but could be offered.
* **Enterprise/Team plan:** A business-oriented license where a company can buy bulk seats or a custom branded version for employees. This might include admin dashboards and group features. Pricing could be per-seat per-year (e.g. \$10–\$20/user/month).
* **In-app purchases:** Perhaps sell add-ons (like extra cloud storage, custom template packs, or one-off expert-generated prompt bundles).
* We would avoid ads (that would conflict with the focused UX).

The *key revenue* is recurring subscription. This is standard for productivity SaaS. Many dashboards (Notion, ClickUp, Todoist) use tiered subscriptions. We’d incentivize yearly plans with discounts. Additionally, partnerships are possible: e.g. affiliating with Spotify/YouTube for curated focus playlists, or featuring premium content (like guided meditations).


Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic App Structure
Set up a Python virtual environment.
Install Flask and SQLite (or SQLAlchemy).
Create a basic Flask app with a home page.
