# Calendar View Switching - URGENT FIX COMPLETE

## Status: âœ… FIXED

### What I Fixed:

1. **CSS Display Logic**: Removed problematic absolute positioning and z-index issues that were causing view switching problems.

2. **JavaScript Event Handlers**: Simplified the event listener attachment and removed timing-related issues.

3. **View Switching Function**: Completely rewrote the `switchView()` function to be more reliable and direct.

4. **Content Generation**: Improved the content generation functions for Day, Week, and Year views with proper error handling.

### Key Changes Made:

#### 1. CSS Fixes (calendar_grid.html):
```css
/* SIMPLIFIED VIEW SWITCHING */
.calendar-grid-wrapper .month-view,
.calendar-grid-wrapper .day-view,
.calendar-grid-wrapper .week-view,
.calendar-grid-wrapper .year-view {
    display: none;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}

/* Active views are fully visible */
.calendar-grid-wrapper .month-view.active {
    display: block;
}

.calendar-grid-wrapper .day-view.active {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

.calendar-grid-wrapper .week-view.active {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

.calendar-grid-wrapper .year-view.active {
    display: block;
    overflow-y: auto;
    padding: 24px;
}
```

#### 2. JavaScript Fixes:
- **Fixed Event Listeners**: Removed redundant event listener code
